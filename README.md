# HRS
Health Recommendation System

A Flask-based web application that provides AI-powered health recommendations based on patient symptoms. The application uses OpenAI's GPT model to analyze symptoms and provide general health advice. It runs using Gunicorn as the WSGI server and can be deployed as a Docker container.

## Features

- Clean and responsive web interface
- Patient symptoms input form with multiple fields (symptoms, duration, severity, additional info)
- AI-powered health recommendations using OpenAI GPT
- Detailed output screen showing symptoms summary and AI-generated recommendations
- Medical disclaimer for user safety
- Production-ready with Gunicorn WSGI server
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- OpenAI API key (get one from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

3. Run with Flask development server:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. Run with Gunicorn (Linux only):
```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t hrs-flask-app .
```

2. Run the container with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:5000 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here --name hrs hrs-flask-app
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

4. Stop the container:
```bash
docker stop hrs
docker rm hrs
```
